Computer science departments should consider assessing students' programming skills each year and having learning modules to address missing skills. I am happy to elaborate on the 5 core modules I am building to address this need.  

One core is data transformation, including indexing, positionality, and read / reporting basics of text and csv data in R and Python. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(computing)

Part I of VII, self-paced training modules on Python's classes, conditionals, data objects, functions, iterators, libraries, and transformers.  
👀   7 Pillars of Python  
👀 👋 7 Pillars of R (expected 12.31.22)  

7 Pillars focuses on Python because can cast unfamiliar data objects to Python built-ins (dictionary, list, etc).
Students quickly GET this.
